        <p>Simple -</p>

<p>A truck full of Pizza starts at Point A headed towards Point B following the flow of hungry people.</p>

<p>Order from the App</p>

<p>Menu is in Half Pizzas Hot and Ready in a safe and sanitary vehicle based warmer. </p>

<p>Set foot towards the location, pick your food, pay and show the driver your order confirmation. As long as your tags match the random codes on the food you've purchased, all he has to do is mark it as picked up and send you away with your food. No cash handling, no swiping a credit card, no wait no lines. </p>

<p>When the clock hits the 2 hour mark, all remaining inventory is delivered to a homeless shelter for immediate consumption 2 hours before the food safety standard 4 hours when steam table food has to be discarded.</p>

<p>It's like Lyft &amp; GrubHub stuffed into an Ice Cream truck. </p>
