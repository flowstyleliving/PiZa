      <section id="main_content">
        <p>What is PiZa? It’s a game that lets you buy and sell real food. In order to play as a seller, you need to be a legally licensed food retailer in the geographic area you play the game in. In order to play as a buyer, you can be any hungry person with a smart device. </p>

<p>Your first job as a seller is to establish start and end points for a round of the game. The start point could be your business address and an end point should be a place to drop off food where the recipients will be excited to see you if you should make it there with food before the game is over. Homeless shelters in game areas as well as low income rec centers and eventually senior facilities will be added to the map strategically and game modifications eventually need to be made to help sellers know when a facility is open and how to safely hand off food in the end. With a start and end point, you then set a route and schedule your traffic pattern so buyers can see where you are. Don’t forget to add live inventory. The rest of the work is play. Leave on time, meet your drops where and when you’re supposed to and see how much food you can get to the end.</p>

<p>How buyers play the game. </p>

<p>Through the app you can purchase the inventory. It makes the most sense to purchase if you’re on the route and want the food you are purchasing. You have very tight windows by which to receive your food, if you should miss a drop, your food will pass you by. Don’t worry though, your food will go to someone who is going to benefit from it if you do miss it. On the off chance that you’re off the route or just feeling generous or just want to get in on the game, you can always purchase the food deliberately and insure that it reaches “the end” by purchasing it anyway with no intent to meet the drop. </p>

<p>Why play: </p>

<p>This game if run properly is actually fun, it circulates real money (for now only real currency) in the economy and it exposes more businesses and consumers to the power of data analysis and economic measurement. </p>

<p>Some will play with hunger in mind, some just for fun.</p>

<p>While I have thought of this app idea many many times, it was the $1M challenge by Salesforce that caused me to sit down and actually try to code it. With a Million dollars, a smaller prize, or maybe even just because I finally turned the idea into a simple working app, the next steps may just unfold in front of me. Besides, the hill to climb for mobile app dev was too much for me to endure. With Force.com and the tools provided through the hackathon, I’ll be able to develop this with less skill and effort, so it’s really made possible by the event even without winning the money. </p>

<p>For now the app is simple. It’s business potential is simple. It’s utilization is simple and even in a worst case scenario, that being food that doesn’t sell, it helps some people a little bit.</p>

<p>The whole ball of wax idea is that food suppliers can gamify their market research by putting real food on the line. Through generous game players and hopefully sellers guessing a little bit too high in the beginning we get to feel good being able to serve vulnerable human beings in the end. </p>

<p>This has the potential to become a profitable game for all parties involved and since those at the end of the line aren’t depending on or waiting for this food to reach them, it’s a non harmful situation if a seller clears their inventory before the finish line. In fact it is built into the drop limits to make sure that too much food doesn’t end up at the same end point and cause unwanted spoilage.</p>

<p>To start out we are going to use equipment to keep the food frozen and serve only ice cream, that when stored properly does not spoil. Ultimately this app can expand out and include all kinds of prepared foods though and really help meet a growing demand for just in time meal solutions in the foodservice industry. This is not just a way to give food away. It’s ultimately a way to gently progress from our current food supply methods to a more balanced economic set of tools for leveling the sales arc and growing food businesses in sustainable healthy way.</p>

<p>Eventually I want to add a timer that allows us to test the price elasticity of demand as well as help collect data for traffic patterns (literal and analytic traffic) and sales patterns. </p>

<p>While I did study both Computer Science and Economics in college, this is truly a hack on my part. It’s not my primary business, though it is a way to tie my day to day life and my personal passions together with a real business that could easily take over and become my single greatest focus. If I can ever figure out how to make that happen it would be my joy to turn this into a real company and start to create jobs in San Francisco developing this app into many future iterations and improvements. </p>

<p>Additional credentials. I am a certified food manager in the state of California and while I only ever used it to dabble as a commercial kitchen tenant practicing pizza recipes and as a vending machine operator with a twist, PiZa is an actual sole proprietorship in the city and county of San Francisco. Developing an app was always the intent, but the road seemed just too long until I found the Salesforce platform to build on. </p>

<p>Last note: It may seem strange to bring ice cream treats to homeless shelters (or not), but I can assure you that people who are struggling to find their way back into the mainstream economy, which contrary to some beliefs most shelter residents in fact are trying to do, can be seriously and positively impacted by small gestures of goodwill that offer some kind of simple joy. It doesn’t always have to be a life changing gift that helps a person make a needed mental shift. Once you get their trajectory right anything is possible. </p>
